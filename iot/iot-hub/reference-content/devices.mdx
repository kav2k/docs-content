## Overview

Devices can be any system able to connect to IoT Hub. Whether it is a connected device or a piece of software running on a computer. They can publish and subscribe to topics to exchange messages.

A device can be enable or disabled at any time. Disabling a Device will disconnect it and prevent reconnection.

A device can be reassigned to another Hub using the **Change Hub** feature.

<Message type="note">

the Device name cannot be changed after the Device has been added. The description field can be changed anytime.

</Message>

<Message type="tip">

an MQTT Webclient is available in the console to publish and receive messages as any device, please refer to the [tutorial](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/use-mqtt-webclient).

</Message>

## Connection Security

For each Device you can choose whether to **allow** or **deny** insecure connections.

We strongly encourage you to use mutual-TLS connections to exchange messages between the Hub and the Devices.

Here are the connection options:
- mutually authenticated TLS is secure: using certificates to authenticate and the connection is encrypted
- "regular" (server only authenticated) TLS is insecure: your device needs to authenticate with its Device identifier
- plaintext is insecure: same as above, plus the connection isn't encrypted

When you **deny** insecure connections, mutual-TLS is the only connection option for the Device.

When you **allow** insecure connections, all 3 options are available to the Device.

## Authentication

A Device can authenticate itself with a Hub in 2 possible ways:
- using a **certificate**, the certificate can be either signed by the Hub certificate authority or associated to the Device
- using its **Device identifier** as MQTT username, if insecure connection is allowed for this device

<Message type="note">

using a certificate is only possible when connecting with mutual TLS authentication

</Message>

## Device Certificates

A Device certificate is a way for a Device to authenticate itself with its Hub.

For your convenience, your Hub's certificate authority is Scaleway-generated, IoT Hub will issue a Scaleway-generated Device certificate when you add a new Device.

If you want to provide the certificate, you can upload a certificate to associate it with a Device.

Whether your Device certificate is **Scaleway-generated** or **customer-provided**, the Device can connect to your Hub using it even if the certificate is not signed by the Hub certificate authority.

The Device certificate can be renewed and replaced in the Device overview tab.

<Message type="important">

when you renew or replace the certificate for a Device, it will be disconnected and will need the new certificate to reconnect.

</Message>

<Message type="note">

if you changed the Hub certificate authority, we cannot issue certificates anymore, and thus the Device certificate renewal feature is disabled.

</Message>

## Message Filters

Message filtering **restricts** topics a Device can **publish** and **subscribe** to.

For both publish and subscribe operations you can choose a **policy** and a **topic list**. The policy instructs the filter to either **accept** the topics in the list (and hence reject all others) or **reject** the topics in the list (and hence allow all others).

Filtered out messages will be dropped and a Hub Event will be generated. Filtered out subscriptions will be rejected at subscription time.

Message filters can be set up in the Device messages tab.

<Message type="tip">

you can use wildcards in the topic list.

</Message>

<Message type="note">

filters also apply on will messages.

</Message>

## Multiple connections

By default, your Devices can only issue 1 simultaneous connection to your Hub. When a second connection is issues, the first one is disconnected. You can change this by allowing multiple connections for a Device.

<Message type="note">

each simultaneous connection to your Hub needs to have a different MQTT Client ID. You can leave it empty and the Hub will generate one for you.

</Message>

You can allow/forbid multiple connections for a Device on the Device overview tab.

<Message type="requirement">

this feature is only available on dedicated and high-availability plans.

</Message>

## Metrics

Devices generate 2 usage metrics:
- **Message count**: tells you how many messages the Device sent and received. Any MQTT message, whether it is a data or a control message, is counted as a Hub message.
- **Device activity**: tells you whether the Device was seen connected to the Hub during the time range.

All metrics are provided within 5 available ranges:
- last 60 minutes: 1 per minute
- last 24 hours: 1 per hour
- last 7 days: 1 per 4 hours
- last 30 days: 1 per day
- last 365 days: 1 per month

The **message count** metric is available in the Device messages tab. The **Device activity** metric is available in the Device overview tab.
