**IoT Hub** is a managed **message broker** dispatching messages between **devices**, **services** and **applications** using a publish/subscribe pattern.

It allows true hotplug, many-to-many, and asynchronous communications.

## Networks

Networks are the front door to your IoT Hub, they allow devices and applications to exchange messages with the Hub through multiple protocols: MQTT, WebSockets, LoRaWAN, SigFox, REST, ... 

Each Network has its protocol-related specifics you can find in the [reference documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/networks/).

## Security

Device communications can be secured with Mutual TLS authentication and encryption, Server-authentication TLS or Plain communication (no security) along with per-device message filtering.

For more information about the different authentication protocols, refer to our [reference documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/devices/).

## Message dispatching

At the heart of your IoT Hub is a highly-available publish/subscribe message broker.

The publish/subscribe pattern is easy: when a client **publishes** a message to a `topic`, all clients which have previously **subscribed** to the `topic` receive a copy of the message. That simple.

<Message type="note">
topics can be any slash-separated string, just like an file path. There is no need to configure them before usage.
</Message>

On top of that, there are multiple features such as topics wildcards, message retention, QoS levels, ... please head to our [reference documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/hubs/) for more information.

## Routes

Routes are the glue between your IoT Hub and other non-publish/subscribe services.

They subscribe to the requested topics and forward messages to services such as databases, object storage, REST APIs, Serverless Functions, AI Inference models and much more.

Services can reply with a message to publish back on your IoT Hub. For more information, check our [reference documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/routes/).
