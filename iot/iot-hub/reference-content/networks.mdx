## Overview

IoT Networks are the **front doors** to your IoT Hub. Each Network provides a way for Devices to connect to a Hub with a different **protocol**.

There are 2 kind of Networks:
- **Device-aware** Networks: the connections using those Networks are tied to a registered IoT Device. All Device features apply to connected clients (authentication, filtering, metrics, ...).
- **Device-unaware** Networks: the connections using those Networks are directly routed to the message broking service. These would be used when there is a device authentication and management middleware between the devices and your Hub.

All Networks are available in the Networks tab of your Hub. From there you can add and remove Networks.

<Message type="note">

Each Hub has 2 default Networks available (MQTT and Websocket), these can't be modified. Other Networks can be added and removed on-demand.

</Message>

Some Networks allow for setting a topic prefix, all messages published through them will have this prefix prepended to the message topic. You can leave it empty if you want to allow the Network to access the entire topic space.

## Default MQTT Network

This is a **Device-aware** network providing MQTT protocol.

You can connect your Devices on this network using the following methods:
- MQTT over **mutually-authenticated TLS**, on TCP port 8883. Authenticate with certificates.
- MQTT over **server-authenticated TLS**, on TCP port 8883. Authenticate with Device ID as MQTT username.
- **Plaintext** MQTT, on TCP port 1883. Authenticate with Device ID as MQTT username.

<Message type="requirement">

to use server-authenticated TLS or plaintext, your Devices need to be configured to allow insecure connections.

</Message>

For your Devices to authenticate the Hub when using TLS, the Hub server-side certificate authority is available for downloading along with endpoint information in the Networks tab.

Head to [this HOWTO](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/connect-default-mqtt-network/) to learn how to use this Network.

## Default Websocket Network

This is a **Device-aware** network providing MQTT-over-Websockets protocol.

You can connect your Devices on this network using the following methods:
- MQTT over **secure Websockets**, on TCP port 443. Authenticate with Device ID as MQTT username.
- MQTT over **Websockets**, on TCP port 80. Authenticate with Device ID as MQTT username.

<Message type="requirement">

your Devices using this Network should be configured to allow insecure connections since mutually-authenticated TLS is not available.

</Message>

<Message type="note">

server certificate for this Network is signed by Let's Encrypt, no need to download and install it, your browser should trust it out-of-the-box.

</Message>

## REST Networks

This is a **Device-unaware** network allowing you to publish messages on a Hub through a REST API.

Creating a REST network will provide you with a secret token to use when calling this API.

Head to [this HOWTO](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/setup-use-rest-network/) to learn how to use this Network.

## Sigfox Networks

This is a **Device-unaware** network allowing you to publish messages on a Hub from the Sigfox infrastructure.

Creating a Sigfox network will provide you with a secret token to use to set up the required callbacks in your Sigfox backend.

Head to [this HOWTO](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/setup-use-sigfox-network/) to learn how to use this Network.
