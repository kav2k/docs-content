## Overview

Kickstarts are Scaleway instances created, installed, and configured to run an application to get you started with some of the most typical IoT use cases.

There currently are 4 available use cases:
- **Data visualisation**: get data from your sensors, store them in a time-series database (InfluxDB), and visualize them using a dashboarding tool (Grafana). [Learn more...]()
- **Logging**: get logs from your systems, store them in a centralized document database (ElasticSearch), and explore them using a friendly interface (Kibana)
- **Flow programming**: trigger simple application flows in a visual editor (NodeRED) by connecting functional boxes together
- **Function as a Service**: trigger your code upon receiving messages with a FaaS framework (Nuclio)

When you create a Kickstart, we will spawn a new DEV1-S instance on your Scaleway account, install the required software and configure it to connect to the selected Hub as the selected Device.

since the Kickstart connects as an existing Device, it can't get its Device certificate, you need to allow insecure connections for this Device.
