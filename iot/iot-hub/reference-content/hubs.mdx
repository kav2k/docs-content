## Overview

A Hub provides message broking, device authentication, networks, routes, and much more features. Take a look at the [introduction](/iot/iot-hub/introduction/) for a summarized version.

Devices and services can exchange messages connected to the same Hub.

You can enable and disable your Hub anytime. When disabled all Devices will be disconnected and the Hub won't be billed while disabled.

## Plans

Hubs come in different flavors (plans):
- **shared**: a great way to start using IoT Hub for free, on a shared message broker while still isolated from other customers.
- **dedicated**: your Hub will be located on a dedicated message broker with its own resources.
- **high-availability** (HA): your Hub will be backed by a pair of dedicated message brokers, providing a very resilient service.

<Message type="note">

the full feature table is available on the [Hub creation form](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/hubs/create).

</Message>

## Certificate Authority

When you create a Hub, it comes with a Scaleway-generated certificate authority to make your life easier. The Hub certificate authority is used to authenticate devices connecting using mutual TLS authentication.

<Message type="note">

the Hub certificate authority is for authenticating Devices. This is not to be confused with MQTT Network certificate authority which allows the Devices to authenticate the Hub.

</Message>

If you wish, you can replace the Hub certificate authority with your own, your device certificates will then have to be signed by this new authority.

<Message type="note">

the Hub should be disabled to replace its certificate authority.

</Message>

This can be done in the Hub Overview tab. You will also find there whether the current certificate authority is the Scaleway-generated one or another you uploaded previously.

<Message type="note">

you can refer to the Devices [reference documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/devices/) to learn more about device authentication.

</Message>

<Message type="requirement">

the mutual TLS authentication is available only on Hub's MQTT Network.

</Message>

## Auto Provisioning

Upon connecting a not-yet-known device with a valid certificate (signed by Hub certificate authority), your Hub can automatically add it to its device list if you enable the auto-provisioning feature, otherwise connection will be denied.

This feature can be enabled/disabled in the Hub Overview tab.

<Message type="requirement">

you need set your Hub certificate authority before enabling this feature.

</Message>

<Message type="requirement">

auto-provisioning only work with mutual TLS, and thus with Hub's MQTT Network.

</Message>

<Message type="note">

a Hub event will be sent when a Device is auto-provisioned.

</Message>

## Events

Your IoT Hub will generate events when something happens which requires your attention. It can be devices violating the security policies you defined, routes with invalid targets, ...

When such an event happens, the Hub will publish a message on itself. The topic depends on the event itself and prefix you configured. You can receive the events by subscribing to these topics.

Events can be enabled/disabled in the Hub Overview tab. The events publish prefix can also be configured from there.

Event messages will be published using topics with following format `prefix/source/identifier/severity`, where:
- `prefix` is the prefix you configured
- `source` tells which ressource kind triggered the event (hub, device, route, ...)
- `identifier` is the ressource identifier (hub ID, device ID, route ID, ...)
- `severity` is tells how important the event is (info, warning, error, ...)

For more information about events, please head to [this page](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/understand-event-messages).

## Metrics

Hubs generate 2 usage metrics:
- **Message count**: tells you how many messages transited through your Hub. Any MQTT message, whether it is a data or a control message, is counted as a Hub message.
- **Active devices**: tells you how many different devices have connected to your Hub.

All metrics are provided within 5 available ranges:
- last 60 minutes: 1 per minute
- last 24 hours: 1 per hour
- last 7 days: 1 per 4 hours
- last 30 days: 1 per day
- last 365 days: 1 per month

The Hub metrics are available in the Hub Metrics tab.
