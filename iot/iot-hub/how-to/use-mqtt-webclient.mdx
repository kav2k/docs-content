## Overview

For your convenience we have embedded an MQTT WebClient in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/hubs).

You can use it to connect to your Hub as a Device and publish and subscribe to topics on the Hub without having to set up a command line tool on your computer.

The WebClient can be accessed from two locations in the Console:
- from any Device overview tab: there is an **MQTT Webclient** button on the top right of the page
- from the Networks tab: on the **Default Websocket Network** line, there is a button to open the WebClient

<Message type="requirement">

since the WebClient uses Websockets, the Device you want to connect as needs to allow insecure connections.

</Message>

## Usage

If you opened the WebClient from a Device overview tab, it will automatically connect to the Hub as this Device. If you opened it from the Networks tab, you need to set the `Username` field to a valid Device ID and click the connect button.

Once connected (as shown by the green indicator), the simplest operation we can do is subscribe to a topic, publish a message to this topic, and verify we received this message.

1. In the **Subscriptions** panel, click on the **Add a new subscription** button
2. Choose `my/topic` as the topic and hit the **Subscribe** button
3. In the **Publish** panel, write `my/topic` in the **Topic** field, `Hello World` in the **Message** field, and hit the **Publish** button
4. The message should appear in the **Messages** panel
