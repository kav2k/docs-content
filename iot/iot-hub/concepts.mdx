<Concept opened>

## Auto-provisioning

Auto-provisioning allows your Hub to automatically onboard devices which are not yet known, when the device provides valid TLS credentials.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Client

A client refers to any software connected to the IoT Hub, whether it is running on a connected device (firmware), an IoT Gateway or a server (application).

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Device

A device is a representation of a [client](#client) for the Hub. Devices allow the Hub to authenticate clients and behave differently for each of them. This includes connecting the client to the Hub, message filtering and collecting metrics. See [Understanding Devices](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/devices/) for more information.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Device authentication

To authenticate a device, the Hub may use:

- the client certificate signature and common name, matching the Hub certificate authority and Device name
- the client certificate fingerprint, matching a Device certificate
- the MQTT username, matching a Device ID (if the Device is configured to allow insecure connections)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Device certificate

A Device certificate is an alternative method for client authentication. A customer can provide any certificate for a specific Device. In this case, the certificate doesn't need to be signed by the Hub certificate authority.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub server certificate authority

Upon connecting to IoT Hub using TLS, MQTT clients will be provided with a Hub server certificate. The client can verify this certificate using the Hub server certificate authority.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub certificate authority

This is the certificate authority the Hub will use to verify the certificate provided by a connecting client.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub Events

Hub Events may be understood as log entries for your Hub. They are published on the Hub whenever and triggered by events such as errors, security notices and auto-provisioning events.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Insecure connection

A connection is deemed insecure if mutual TLS is not enabled for it. This implies authenticating with a token which is weaker than using a certificate. Devices may be allowed to **allow** or **deny** insecure connections. If allowed, **TLS** and **Plaintext** are available. **mTLS** is always available.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Kickstart

A Kickstart is a Scaleway Instance which is spawned, installed and configured for you to showcase a typical IoT use case.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message

Messages are the base data transmission unit for IoT Hub. A message contains a payload (can be any data) and a topic (any string, indicates what is in the payload). The Hub dispatches messages between connected clients.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message Broker

IoT Hub is a message broker. It dispatches messages from publishers to subscribers. With IoT Hub, subscribers receive a copy of published messages they are subscribed to. See [Understanding Hubs](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/hubs/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message Filter

Message filters restrict the messages a Device can publish or subscribe to. Each filter can be configured to allow or reject given topics.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## MQTT

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol for exchanging messages between devices and/or applications. Find out more about MQTT [on our blog](https://blog.scaleway.com/introduction-to-mqtt-protocol/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

Mutual TLS is a method for mutual authentication. It indicates that both the TLS client and TLS server are required to authenticate each other. This implies that both parties possess a certificate to provide to the remote party, and a certificate authority to verify the certificate provided by the other party.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Network

Networks are the front doors to a Hub. Each network supports a different protocol to exchange messages with the Hub. See [Understanding Networks](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/networks/) for more information.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Publish/Subscribe

The publish/subscribe model (also known as pub/sub) provides an alternative to traditional client-server architecture. In the client-sever model, a client communicates directly with the application supposed to receive the information. The pub/sub model decouples the client that sends a message (the publisher) from the client or clients that receive the messages (the subscribers). The publishers and subscribers never contact each other directly. In fact, they are not even aware that the other exists. MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Quality of Service levels (QoS)

Quality of Service levels determine the reliability of the data flow between a client and the broker. The message may be sent in 3 ways:

- QoS 0: the message will be received **at most once** (also known as "fire and forget").
- QoS 1: the message will be received **at least once**.
- QoS 2: the message will be received **exactly once**.

Increasing the QoS level decreases message throughput because of the additional exchanges required between the client and the broker.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Routes

IoT Routes forward messages to non publish/subscribe destinations such as databases, REST APIs, Serverless functions and S3 buckets. See [Understanding Routes](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/routes/) for further information.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## TLS

TLS, and its now-deprecated predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network. For example, a cryptographic protocol encrypts the data that is exchanged between a web server and a user. See also [Mutual TLS](#mutualtls-mtls)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Topic

A topic indicates what information is contained in a message. The message broker uses topics to forward published messages to the right subscribers. Learn more about topics [on our blog](https://blog.scaleway.com/scaleway-iot-hub-introduction-to-mqtt-topics/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Websocket

A websocket is a way for a browser to upgrade an HTTP connection into a somewhat "raw" TCP connection. By doing so, the HTTP server is now able to send data to the HTTP client without the client having to request it.

</Concept>
