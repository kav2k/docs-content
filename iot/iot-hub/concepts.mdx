## Overview

To discover IoT Hub at a glance, please first read [IoT Hub Overview](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/overview)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Auto-provisioning

Auto-provisioning allows your Hub to automatically onboard not-yet-known devices when they provide valid TLS credentials.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Client

A Client refers to any software connected to the IoT Hub, whether it is running on a connected device (firmware), an IoT Gateway or a server (application).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Device

A device is a representation of a “client” for the Hub. It allows the Hub to authenticate a client and behave differently for each of them. This includes connecting the client to the its Hub, message filtering, metrics collection, ... See [understanding Devices](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/devices/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Device authentication

To authenticate a device, the Hub may rely on:

- the client certificate signature and common name, matching Hub certificate authority and Device name
- the client certificate fingerprint, matching a Device certificate
- the MQTT username, matching a Device ID (if the Device is configured to allow insecure connections)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Device certificate

A Device certificate is an alternate method for client authentication. A customer can provide any certificate for a specific Device. In this case, the certificate doesn't need to be signed by the Hub certificate authority.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub server certificate authority

Upon connecting to IoT Hub using TLS, MQTT clients will be provided with a Hub server certificate. The client can verify this certificate using the Hub server certificate authority.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub certificate authority

This is the certificate authority the Hub will use to verify the certificate provided by a connecting client.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Hub Events

Hub Events may be understood as log entries for your Hub. They are published on the Hub whenever and triggered by events such as errors, security notices, auto-provisioning events, ...

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Insecure connection

A connection is deemed insecure if mutual TLS is not enabled for it, this implies authenticating with a token which is weaker than using a certificate. Devices may be allowed to **allow** or **deny** insecure connections. If allowed, **TLS** and **Plaintext** are available. **mTLS** is always available.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Kickstart

Kickstarts instances spawned, installed, and configured for you to showcase some typical IoT use cases.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message

Messages are the base data transmission unit for IoT Hub. A message contains a payload (can be any data) and a topic (any string, indicates what is in the payload). The Hub dispatches the messages between connected clients.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message Broker

IoT Hub is a message broker, it dispatches messages from publishers to subscribers. With IoT Hub subscribers receive a copy of published messages they subscribed to. See [understanding Hubs](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/hubs/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Message Filter

Message filters restrict the messages a Device can publish or subscribe to. Each filter can be configured to allow or reject given topics.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## MQTT

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol to exchange messages between devices and/or applications. More about MQTT [on our blog](https://blog.scaleway.com/introduction-to-mqtt-protocol/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## mutual TLS (mTLS)

Mutual TLS indicates both the TLS client and TLS server are required to authenticate each other. This implies both parties possess a certificate to provide to the remote party, and a certificate authority to verify the certificate provided by the other party.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Network

Networks are the front doors to a Hub, each one supports a different protocol to exchange messages with the Hub. See [understanding Networks](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/networks/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Publishe/Subscribe

The publish/subscribe pattern (also known as pub/sub) provides an alternative to traditional client-server architecture. In the client-sever model, a client communicates directly with the application supposed to receive the information. The pub/sub model decouples the client that sends a message (the publisher) from the client or clients that receive the messages (the subscribers). The publishers and subscribers never contact each other directly. In fact, they are not even aware that the other exists. MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Quality of Service levels (QoS)

Quality of Service levels determine the reliability of the data flow between a client and the broker. The message may be sent in 3 ways:

- QoS 0: the message will be received **at most once** (also known as "fire and forget").
- QoS 1: the message will be received **at least once**.
- QoS 2: the message will be received **at exactly once**.

Increasing QoS level decreases message throughput because of the additional exchanges required between the client and the broker.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Routes

IoT Routes forward messages to non publish/subscribe destinations such as databases, REST APIs, Serverless functions, S3 buckets... see [understanding Routes](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/routes/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Topic

A topic indicates what information is contained in a message. The message broker uses topics to forward published messages to the right subscribers. More about topics [on our blog](https://blog.scaleway.com/scaleway-iot-hub-introduction-to-mqtt-topics/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Websocket

A websocket is a way for a browser to upgrade an HTTP connection into a somewhat "raw" TCP connection. By doing so, the HTTP server is now able to send data to the HTTP client without the client having to request it.

</Concept>
